# Recommendation System Using SVD and Surprise Library

## Overview
This project implements a recommendation system for movie/book/user preference predictions using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The system utilizes the `surprise` library to build, train, and evaluate the recommendation model. The SVD technique is commonly used for collaborative filtering in recommender systems, which helps predict user ratings based on their past interactions.

## Dependencies

- `surprise`: A Python library for building and analyzing recommender systems.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.

You can install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install surprise pandas numpy
